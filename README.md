# Creations – A Repository of Ideas and Inventions  

Welcome to **Creations**, a personal archive of my ideas and inventions, shared openly for inspiration, remixing, and development. While these ideas originate from me, everyone is invited to explore, refine, and bring them to life.  

## Guiding Principles  
### 🛠️ **Reliability & Repairability**  
Every idea in this repository is designed with **long-term usability** in mind. Wherever possible, creations should be **durable, maintainable, and easy to repair**, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.  

### 🔓 **Open-Source & Extendable**  
All ideas are shared **openly** under the **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** license, ensuring that designs can be studied, modified, and improved. The goal is to foster a **collaborative ecosystem** where anyone can extend and adapt these ideas to fit their needs.  

### 🌍 **Accessible & Buildable for Everyone**  
If feasible, each creation will be designed with **global accessibility in mind**—using materials, tools, and manufacturing methods that are widely available. The aim is to ensure that as many people as possible can **build, construct, and benefit** from these ideas, no matter where they are in the world.  

## How It Works  
- **Organized by Year** – Ideas are sorted chronologically for easy navigation.  
- **Unique Identifiers** – Each creation has a distinct number for reference.  
- **Open for Collaboration** – Feel free to expand on these ideas, discuss them, or bring them to life!  

Let’s build a future where great ideas are **shared, accessible, and built to last**! 🚀
